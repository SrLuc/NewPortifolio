## Functionalities

This project was developed using React, with Javascript and I also used *TailwindCSS* for its styling.

I made use of libraries like *React-Router-Dom* to define the pages that will be rendered.

I used libraries like *React-Icons, React-Scroll, React-Slick and React-Carousel* to add extra functionality Icons, Smooth Scrolling, Container Animation and Carousels

In addition, this project follows good programming practices, using the ES6 syntax of Javascript, such as the use of Hooks such as **UseState** to change the state, verify and render data, In addition, I also used the Hook **UseEffect** to make Github *API* calls and render my repositories in realtime.
